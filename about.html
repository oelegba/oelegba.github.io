  <div class="about">
    <p>Children go through certain stages of development in different paces. Manhattan Nursery School provides children with a developmentally appropriate program so that each child is able to learn and develop his/her skills throughout social and emotional interactions.

We are focused on creating a safe, warm, nurturing and learning environment for our children to develop healthy self expression and be life long achievers. Also, we help children be able to learn different cultures and similarities and differences among them while storybooks and multicultural dolls help enhance their appreciation of their peers.
Our carefully screened staff members dedicate themselves to the safe, quality, genuine care of your children. All staff members are trained in CPR and First Aid and are subject to random drug testing. In addition, we conduct thorough FBI and local background checks on all employees.

Drop-in, flexible care allows you, as parents, to get the quality you seek in child care during the hours you need it. We provide quality education in a loving, safe environment, even during non-traditional hours. The PlanetKid staff believes that you, as a parent, should still expect quality care even if you do not work a 9-to-5 job..</p>
